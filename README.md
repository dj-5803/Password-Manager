# Password-Manager

This is a simple password manager console application written in Python. It allows users to securely store website or service credentials (username and password) along with a master password for access. Additionally, it provides options to back up and restore password entries to/from a JSON file named `passwords.json`. 

This project is intended for educational purposes and serves as a basic example of a password manager. It does not cover all security aspects or robust encryption methods used in professional password managers. Use it responsibly and consider implementing additional security features before using it to store sensitive data.
